                This application was developed to create a simpler, more customised application to create and test experiments
                on (compared to existing websites such as Google Forms). Experiments comparing images and videos can be run here, more
                variations may be added in the future. Functionality includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Creating experiments, with the ability to modify the experiment through customisable options
                </li>
                <li>
                    Letting users take such experiments
                </li>
                <li>
                    Exporting results as .csv
                </li>
                <li>
                    Basic account system to prevent unregistered users from creating/modifying experiments
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Registered users can create experiments for a given set of images or videos. These files must include a "base" set
                of files, and another set of files for algorithms applied to the base set. There currently exist three types
                of experiments to compare files:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Pairwise Comparison - Choose which files is best
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ranking - Organise files set in order of best to worst
                </li>
                <li>
                    Rating - Assign value to each files in set
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Results are stored in a PostgreSQL database, admins can export them as a .csv file.
