                This application was developed to create a simpler, more customised application to create and test experiments
                on (compared to existing websites such as Google Forms). Experiments comparing images can be run here, more
                variations may be added in the future. Functionality includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Creating experiments, with the ability to modify the experiment through customisable options
                </li>
                <li>
                    Letting users take such experiments
                </li>
                <li>
                    Viewing the results of such experiments and exporting as .csv
                </li>
                <li>
                    Basic account system to prevent unregistered users from creating/modifying experiments
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Registered users can create experiments for a given set of images. These images must include a "base" set
                of images, and another set of images for algorithms applied to the base set. There currently exist types
                of experiments to compare images:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Pairwise Comparison - Choose which image is best
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ranking - Organise image set in order of best to worst
                </li>
                <li>
                    Rating - Assign value to each image in set
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Results are stored in a [FOR NOW] SQLite database, admins can view such results in browser or choose to
                export them as a .csv file.
