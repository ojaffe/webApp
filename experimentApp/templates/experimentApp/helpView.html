            This page contains documentation about this application. If you have any further questions,
            please <a href="{% url 'experimentApp:contactView' %}">contact us</a>.

            <h3 class="mt-5" style="color: #424a8c">Quick Start</h3>
            <p>Follow these steps to quickly set up an experiment:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Create an experiment, selecting the appropriate options and writing its description in a lot of detail
                </li>
                <li>
                    Send all participants the link to take the experiment, this link is given after creating an experiment,
                    on the <i>Experiment Detail</i> page
                </li>
                <li>
                    Download the results once all participants have finished, results can be found on the
                    <i>Experiment Detail</i> page
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="mt-5">Account System</h3>
            <p>Some functionality of this application is restricted to users who have an account, such as creating an
            experiment or viewing results. In this documentation, processes that require an account will be
            denoted with "(A)" in their title. If you believe you require an account but do not have one, please
                <a href="">contact us</a>.</p>

            <p>Users without an account can participate in experiments.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-5">Creating an Experiment (A)</h3>
            <p>All experiments require a title and description. These will be
            presented to the participant when they start the experiment, so provide necessary information about the
            experiment that the participant will need to know. Note that participants are told how to answer each question.
            The title of an experiment will also be used by admins to identify an experiment from others when viewing,
                all experiments, so choose their name carefully.</p>

            <p>Images are required for every experiment. <b style="color: red">TODO</b></p>
            <p>Images must have consistent naming and resolution <b style="color: red">TODO</b></p>

            <p>Currently, three different types of questions are supported for a given set of images:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Pairwise Comparison</b> - Select an image
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Ranking</b> - Order the images
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Rating</b> - Give a rating (number, choice out of five e.g.) to each image
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Using one of the above you can have participants judge images by some metric, for example simply having
            the participants judge them by how good they look. Admins have the option to customise these questions,
                below we will explain each questions options.</p>

            <p>Selecting ground truth will present the original image to the participant, and will remove it from being
            an option to answer.</p>

            <p><b>Pairwise Comparison</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Ground Truth (see above)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Compare all images from the same image - All images with the same original image (different algorithms
                    applied to some image) will be compared in each question
                </li>
                <li>
                    Perform NC2 comparisons - There will be a question for each combination in the set of images with
                    the same original image, so every image in such set will be compared to every other
                </li>
                <li>
                    Randomise the ordering of the comparisons - The ordering of questions, and the NC2 comparisons if
                    chosen, will be randomised
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add in comparisons with the same image 5% of the time - <b style="color: red">TODO</b>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Ranking</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Ground Truth (see above)
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Rating</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Ground Truth (see above)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Select how the user should answer a question - The admin can choose how the participant will select
                    their rating, can select from input field where they type in the rating, radio chose where they select
                    the rating from a list of choices, or a slider which they can drag.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lower Bound - Smallest possible value the participant can choose
                </li>
                <li>
                    Upper Bound - Largest possible value the participant can choose
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Admins can also change the colour of the text and background that will be displayed the the
            participant during the test.</p>

            <p>Admins also have the option to include a "refresher image". This will cover the entire display and be
            shown for a period of time between questions before disappearing. If selected, admins can choose whether
            to have a specific colour be shown, or a specific image, as well as the time (in milliseconds) that it
                will be shown for.</p>

            <p>Once the admin has entered valid options and clicked the create button, they will be redirected to
            a link containing information about the experiment, which we will explain in the "Experiment Details (A)"
                section below.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-5">Viewing All Previous Experiments (A)</h3>
            <p>Admins can view all experiments by clicking the respective link on the <a href="{% url 'experimentApp:index' %}">home page.</a>
            Here, they will be presented with a list of all previous experiments, sorted such that the most recently
            created are at the top. Each experiment is identified by its title, its type of questions (e.g. ranking) and
                the date and time it was created.</p>

            <p>Clicking any of the experiment titles will navigate the admin to a page which allows them to manage
                such experiment, more is explained in the below "Experiment Details (A)" section.</p>


            <h3 class="mt-5">Experiment Details (A)</h3>
            <p>This page holds details about an experiment such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    URL of page where participants can take experiment
                </li>
                <li>
                    Results
                </li>
                <li>
                    Title+description
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>There also exists the option to access an experiments results. Either the admin can download the .csv file,
            or they can choose to go to another page to view more extensive results in-browser without having to
                download and query the results. Depending on the experiment type more columns may be added to the
                .csv file, if so this will be explained to the user. The results are explained more in depth below.</p>

            <p>Admins can also choose to delete experiments on this page - a confirmation is shown to help prevent
                mistakes.</p>


            <h3 class="mt-5">Experiment Results (A)</h3>
            <p>This view contains displayed results for a specific experiment, as well as the option to download the
            results in a .csv file. Depending on the experiment type more columns may be added to the
                .csv file, if so this will be explained to the user. <b style="color: red">TODO</b></p>

            <p>For each experiment we want to know how each participant answered the questions, thus we need to be able
            to differentiate between several participants answering the experiment, perhaps simultaneously. To manage
            this we use <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/http/sessions/">Django sessions</a>. Each
            user is "signed up" for an experiment upon starting it, and their session is given a unique key to link
            that user with that experiment. Thus, on all future HTTP GET requests for experiment questions, the
            participants client can provide such key to authenticate with the server that they have registered for
            such experiment. This functionality prevents participants from answering multiple experiments at once. Note,
            if a participant has already "signed up" for an experiment and re-enters the consent form, they will be
                registered under a new key, so their results will appear under a different user.</p>


            <h3 class="mt-5">Experiment Consent</h3>
            <p>To navigate to this link participants must be given its URL, for convenience this is displayed to the
                admin after they create the experiment, on the <i>Experiment Details</i> page.</p>

            <p>Before a participant can begin an experiment, they are forced to check that they consent to several statements
            (<b style="color: red">CHANGE</b>). This page also displays the title of the experiment, as well as its
                description that was given when creating the experiment.</p>

            <p>After a participant has consented to everything and clicked the button, their client will be
            registered with the experiment (explained more in depth above in "Experiment Results (A)"), and they will
                be redirected to the first question.</p>

            <h3 class="mt-5">Question</h3>
            <p>The design and functionality of each question will be very different depending on the options, so we will
                break this into separate sections for each type of question.</p>

            <p>In every type of question, participants can enlarge images to their original resolution by clicking on them.
            This will darken the display and show the respective image at the center of the screen. Clicking anywhere
            on the display will remove this view. Note that sometimes images are resized depending on the resolution
            of the display, but they will never be scaled above their original resolution and the original image can
                be seen by clicking it.</p>

            <h4 class="mt-3" style="color: #424a8c">Pairwise Comparison</h4>
            <p>Participants will be shown several images, and be asked to choose one. They can select an image by clicking
                the radio choice, or its label, next to the image.</p>

            <p>If there are more than four images, they will be displayed in rows with four images per row. The images
                may also be scaled depending on the display resolution, as we noted earlier.</p>

            <h4 class="mt-3" style="color: #424a8c">Ranking</h4>
            <p>Participants will be shown several images in a vertical column, and will be asked to arrange these
            in some ordering of their preference. They can change the ordering by holding down the handle associated
                with each image and dragging it up or down.</p>

            <p>Note, for ranking participants must click on every image to enlarge them before they can proceed to
                the next question.</p>

            <h4 class="mt-3" style="color: #424a8c">Rating</h4>
            <p>Participants are shown several images and are asked to rate each one. Depending on how the admin set
            up the experiment, they will have to answer in a particular way:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Input Field - Type rating
                </li>
                <li>
                    Radio - Select rating from list of choices
                </li>
                <li>
                    Slider - Move slider to select rating
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>If there are more than four images, they will be displayed in rows with four images per row. The images
            may also be scaled depending on the display resolution, as we noted earlier. Participants can also
                select an images rating when it is enlarged (not for radio though), for convenience. </p>
